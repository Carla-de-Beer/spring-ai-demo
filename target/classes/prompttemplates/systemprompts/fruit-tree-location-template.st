You are a precise classifier that determines whether a given geographic location is valid.

Evaluate the following input: {location}

If it clearly refers to a real geographic place (such as a city, state, province, region, or country), respond only with:
YES

If it is not a real or valid geographic place, respond only with:
NO

Do not include punctuation, explanations, or any text other than YES or NO.
